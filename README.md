# Envisage, AI Planner

The project is named as Envisage, the act of contemplation or conception of ideas 
towards a series of desirable future events.

<summary>Why work on Envisage?</summary>

An artificial general intelligence (AGI) system needs to be able to envision new ideas, 
contemplate on known knowledge, and revise the ideas based time, place, and circumstances.

To better understand and resolve the challenges involved in building an AI Agent for such
a repetitive yet innovative general task, I'm going to begin by implementing a useful 
journey planner, and then formalize and generalize the Agent for different tasks that involve
complex planning and execution.

<summary>Why a Journey Planner?</summary>

My partner and I like to travel and have great experiences, and I believe the key 
to a great experience is to think about a comfortable plan ahead of time that is robust
to uncertainties. The plan may not be perfect, but every great plan leads to further 
greatly planned journeys. And, learning to build a great plan is data driven, and a kind
of Reinforcement Learning Problem, which triggers me to improve my pre-journey efforts to 
build a better plan next time. 

Additionally, although there are a lot of resources online, a great plan is highly personal 
and needs meticulous planning again and again. I believe this would be useful for many to 
ease their planning and journey and would improve our collective experience.

Thus, a journey planner first, so that I can offload and create journey plans ahead of time
and at scale!
